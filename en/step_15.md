## Testing so far

To test your code so far, save and run your code, then type the following lines into the shell and answer the questions:

```python
city_id = get_city_id()
weather_data = get_weather_data(city_id)
arrival = get_arrival()
forecast = get_forecast(arrival, weather_data)
pprint(forecast)
```

You should see the forecast for the correct city and the date/time displayed on your screen.
