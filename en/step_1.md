## What you will make
In this resource you're going to write a program that will allow a user to type in a city they're travelling to, and the date they'll be arriving. The program will then use [open data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_data) from [OpenWeatherMap](http://openweathermap.org/api) to find out what the weather is like in that city at that time, and advise the user on what they should wear when they arrive.

## What you will learn
By creating the Dress for the Weather project you will learn:

- How weather data can be stored in text files
- How to manipulate JSON files and objects
- How to use Python to access open data APIs
- How to manipulate dictionaries in Python

This resource covers elements from the following strands of the [Raspberry Pi Digital Making Curriculum](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/):
