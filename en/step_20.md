## What next?

- The [OpenWeatherMap](http://openweathermap.org/api) also provides a 16-day forecast. Check out the API and see if you can alter your program to allow for 16 days.

- None of the data inputs have been validated. This means a user could easily type in a city name and forget the capital letter at the start, or type `YES` instead of `y` when checking if the city is correct. They might even enter numbers outside of the range of acceptable dates! You can guarantee that if a user **can** break your software, then they **will**. Why not alter your code to make it more robust?

- Why not integrate your program with a little Minecraft code? You could then add graphical elements to the program to display the different weathers in Minecraft.
